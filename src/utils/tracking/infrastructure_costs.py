"""
Infrastructure cost calculation and credit conversion utilities.

This module provides functions to:
1. Track infrastructure usage (external paid services)
2. Calculate infrastructure costs based on usage
3. Convert costs to credits for unified billing

Pricing is merged from two manifests at module initialization:
- src/tools/manifest/search_providers.json — web-search providers (per depth
  level, keyed "TrackingName:depth" plus a bare "TrackingName" legacy key) and
  auxiliary search tools (images, research).
- src/llms/manifest/providers.json `infrastructure_pricing` — any remaining
  non-search infrastructure entries. Search-manifest keys win on collision.

Free tools (DuckDuckGo, Arxiv) and internal operations (cache, storage, filesystem)
are not charged and will result in 0 credits.

Usage:
    tool_usage = {"TavilySearchTool": 5}
    result = calculate_infrastructure_credits(tool_usage)
    # Returns: {"total_credits": 80.0, "services": {...}}
