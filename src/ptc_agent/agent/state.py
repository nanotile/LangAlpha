"""DeltaChannel state schema for the messages key.

Vendors deepagents' batch reducer as a public `messages_delta_reducer` and
defines `DeltaAgentState` (an `AgentState` whose `messages` uses `DeltaChannel`
for O(1)-per-step checkpoint storage instead of re-serializing the full list).
`DeltaAgentState` is structurally identical to deepagents 0.6.11's
`DeepAgentState` (`AgentState` + `DeltaChannel(reducer, snapshot_frequency=50)`);
we vendor the reducer rather than import the private `deepagents._messages_reducer`
symbol so on-disk reconstruction stays frozen to our release. The parity test
`test_messages_delta_reducer.py::test_vendored_reducer_matches_deepagents` fails
CI if our copy drifts.

One-way data format: once a thread is checkpointed under `DeltaChannel` its head
blob is a sentinel or `_DeltaSnapshot`, which reverting to `add_messages` (or
downgrading langgraph below 1.2) cannot read — so keep the `langgraph`/
`langgraph-checkpoint*` floors pinned at >=1.2 in pyproject.toml.
