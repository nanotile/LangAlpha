    A skill's tools persist via ``loaded_skills`` state, so later turns can skip

    - **No compaction**: the full history is in the model's view, so every
      injected body still survives — trust ``loaded`` as-is.
    - **Compaction**: the body lives only in the message history, which compaction
      summarizes. Reuse ``get_effective_messages`` so this view can't drift from
      what the model actually sees, then drop the lossy summary at index 0 — a body
      that survives only inside the summary is gone verbatim and must be re-injected
      (its tools stay available via state regardless).

    The marker scan is identity-bound: a skill counts as live only when its marker,
    carrying ``mid`` equal to the scanned message's own framework id, is present in
    that message. Content alone can't forge a match (a user-typed marker, or a
    SKILL.md documenting the format, carries a ``mid`` that won't equal the id of the
    message it sits in), so a spurious "still loaded" can't suppress a real body.

    Non-string skill names are filtered out; any unexpected shape degrades to an
