"""Server-side HTML→PDF rendering via headless Chromium (Playwright).

Renders a workspace HTML document — loaded from the server's own loopback
``/api/v1/wsfiles/...`` route — into PDF bytes. Playwright is imported lazily
inside functions so this module never fails to import without the ``pdf`` extra;
callers map ``PdfRenderUnavailable`` to a 501.

SSRF containment: every subresource request is gated by ``_is_request_allowed``,
which permits only the workspace's own serve prefix plus a fixed https CDN
allowlist. Agent-authored HTML therefore cannot reach internal services or
cloud metadata endpoints from inside the server.
