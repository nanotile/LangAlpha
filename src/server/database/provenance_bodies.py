"""Global content-addressed store for raw per-access tool result bodies.

Bodies are keyed by ``result_sha256`` and shared across users/turns: a static
filing fetched many times is stored once. Bodies up to
``RESULT_BODY_MAX_BYTES`` live inline in Postgres; larger bodies keep a
byte-safe head inline and spill the full bytes to object storage under
``provenance/{sha256}``. Every write is best-effort and never raises — losing a
body must not break the turn that produced it. GC is an independent mark-sweep
against ``provenance_records`` (no FK; ``result_sha256`` is the logical link).

# nothing — no row lock, no rewrite — preserving the no-churn DO NOTHING path.

# Why a conditional touch and NOT the obvious `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET

# body (a hot 10-Q fetched by many users) is ONE row that many concurrent turns
# dedup against. DO UPDATE on every hit takes a row write-lock on that hot row
# each time, serializing those turns against each other AND against the GC's
