"""Tests for the skill content layer (``ptc_agent`` skills middleware).

Covers two pure functions that the SkillsMiddleware composes:

- ``build_skill_content`` — the already-loaded dedup that keeps a re-sent skill's
  SKILL.md body from being re-injected every turn while still refreshing its
  (per-turn) instruction.
- ``compute_already_loaded`` — which skills' bodies are still live in the
  effective (post-compaction) message window, so the body can be skipped.

Import + patch targets use the ``src.`` prefix consistently: ``src.ptc_agent.X``
and ``ptc_agent.X`` are distinct module objects, so the patch namespace must match
the import namespace or ``patch`` hits the wrong module.
